}

The function it completed, ```ParseAndProcessResponseAsync```, was correct and passed all tests

The function it was starting to write, ```GetPriceHistoryAsync```, actually exists with slightly diffrent variable names.
### Completed function
```
private static async Task<List<CryptoAssetPriceHistory>> ParseAndProcessResponseAsync(HttpResponseMessage response, DateTime? latestDateInDatabase, string assetId) 
{ 
    var jsonString = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); 
    using var jsonDoc = JsonDocument.Parse(jsonString); 
    var priceHistories = new List<CryptoAssetPriceHistory>(); 
    if (jsonDoc.RootElement.TryGetProperty('prices', out var prices)) 
    { 
        foreach (var price in prices.EnumerateArray()) 
        { 
            var dateUnix = price[0].GetInt64(); 
            var date = DateTimeOffset.FromUnixTimeMilliseconds(dateUnix).UtcDateTime; 
            if (latestDateInDatabase.HasValue && date <= latestDateInDatabase.Value)
